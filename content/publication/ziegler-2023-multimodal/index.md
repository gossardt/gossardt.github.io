abstract: In recent years, robotic table tennis has become a popular research challenge
  for perception and robot control. Here, we present an improved tabl tennis robot
  system with high accuracy vision detection and fast robot reaction. Based on previous
  work, our system contains a KUKA robot arm with 6 DOF, with four frame-based cameras
  and two additional event-based cameras. We developed a novel calibration approach
  to calibrate this multimodal perception system. For table tennis, spin estimation
  is crucial. Therefore, we introduced a novel, and more accurate spin estimation
  approach. Finally, we show how combining the output of an event-based camera and
  a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) can be used for accurate ball detection.
